  const aboutContent = {
    whatIs: "Compress PDF is an intelligent online tool designed to reduce the file size of PDF documents while maintaining optimal visual quality. This free service uses advanced compression algorithms to minimize PDF file sizes, making them easier to share, store, and upload. Whether you're dealing with image-heavy documents, scanned files, or large presentations, our compression tool helps you optimize file sizes without compromising readability or professional appearance.",
    uses: [
      "Reducing large presentation files for faster email transmission and sharing",
      "Optimizing scanned documents that contain high-resolution images or graphics",
      "Compressing academic papers and research documents for online submission",
      "Minimizing file sizes for web uploads and content management systems",
      "Optimizing portfolio files and creative documents for client sharing",
      "Reducing storage space requirements for document archives and backups",
      "Preparing files for mobile viewing and low-bandwidth environments",
      "Optimizing legal documents and contracts for efficient digital distribution"
    ],
    whyUse: "Our Compress PDF tool delivers the perfect balance of size reduction and quality preservation using state-of-the-art compression algorithms. Unlike many online services that apply blanket compression settings, our tool intelligently analyzes your document to determine the optimal compression approach. The process is completely secure â€“ your files are processed entirely in your browser and never uploaded to external servers. We don't add watermarks or impose file size limitations, making it ideal for both personal and professional use. The compression maintains document structure, formatting, and text clarity while significantly reducing file size.",
    howToUse: [
      "Upload your PDF file by clicking the upload area or dragging the file into the interface",
      "Wait for the file to be analyzed and the original file size to be displayed",
      "Click the 'Compress PDF' button to begin the intelligent compression process",
      "Monitor the progress bar as the compression algorithms optimize your document",
      "Review the compression results showing original vs. compressed file sizes",
      "Download the compressed PDF file automatically to your device"
    ],
    example: "Consider a 25MB presentation PDF containing high-resolution images and graphics that you need to email to a client. Email systems typically have attachment limits of 10-25MB, making the original file difficult to send. Using our Compress PDF tool, the file can be reduced to 8MB (a 68% reduction) while maintaining crisp images and clear text. This compressed version loads faster for recipients, takes up less storage space, and can be easily shared through various platforms without quality concerns."

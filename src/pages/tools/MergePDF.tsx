      "Combining multiple contract pages or legal documents into one comprehensive file",
      "Merging chapters of a book or research paper for easier distribution",
      "Consolidating monthly reports into a quarterly summary document",
      "Joining scanned documents that were saved as separate PDF files",

      "Assembling project documentation from multiple team members",
      "Combining invoices or receipts for accounting and bookkeeping purposes",
      "Merging academic papers and citations into a single research document"
    ],
    whyUse: "Our Merge PDF tool stands out as the best free online solution for several compelling reasons.

    howToUse: [
      "Click on the upload area or drag and drop your first PDF file into the designated zone",
      "Add additional PDF files by repeating the upload process - you can merge as many files as needed",
      "Review the list of selected files and ensure they are in the correct order for merging",

      "Wait for the processing to complete - this usually takes just a few seconds",
      "Download the merged PDF file automatically or click the download link when ready"

    example: "Imagine you have three separate PDF files: a cover letter (2 pages), a resume (3 pages), and a portfolio (10 pages). Using our Merge PDF tool, you can upload all three files in sequence, and within seconds, you'll have a single 15-page PDF document containing all your materials in the correct order. This merged file is perfect for job applications, as it presents all your information as one cohesive document that's easy for employers to review and save."
